This is the source code that was behind the website http://ttcskycam.ca/.  It's goal is to give an up-to-the-minute visual representation of public transit conditions in Toronto.  That website is no longer online, due to hosting costs.  

It it based on [NextBus](http://www.nextbus.com/) data.

Here is a video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvE7VrrHjRA 

It is probably difficult, and not very useful, for someone to download this code and run it on their own.  I am hosting this code publicly mostly because I didn't see any reason not to.
