<h2>About 'The Unofficial TTC Traffic Report'</h2>
</p>
<p>
The goal of this website is to show you where TTC streetcars and buses are 
moving slowly and where they are moving well, at any given moment.  It is 
intended to give you a bird's-eye view of what the TTC vehicles are doing along 
the route(s) between you and your destination, to help you decide whether to 
wait for a streetcar as opposed to taking an alternate route, walking, or doing 
something else.
</p><p>
This is made possible by the GPS units that all TTC surface vehicles were 
equipped with in 2011, the data from which has been made freely available to the public by 
the TTC and <a href="http://www.nextbus.com/homepage/">NextBus</a>.  Behind the 
scenes, this website is constantly (i.e. every minute) downloading this data 
from NextBus and storing it.  Then when your browser loads the page, it 
compiles recent data (typically the
last half hour) to generate some graphics - coloured-coded stretches of road, and animated 
vehicles - which are shown on top of a google map.  So
what you see on the google map represents the current situation in the real
world.
</p><p>
This website (which is really only one page) does not rely on TTC schedules 
for the information that it displays.  It is generated from real-time GPS 
vehicle data only.
</p><p>
Anyone can access the raw GPS data for the TTC vehicles.  For example, in most 
browsers you can view the up-to-the-minute raw data for the King streetcar by 
clicking
<a
href="http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=vehicleLocations&a=ttc&r=504&t=0">here</a>. 
There are many websites and apps that do many useful things with this and
related data feeds.  However I could not find any which provided a
straightforward visual traffic report, so that is why I made this website.
</p><p>
This website has many shortcomings and bugs, and it only handles a few routes so far.  It is a work in
progress.  I hope that you find it useful all the same.
