Expect to see a pg_toast_... taking a lot of space.  (reports table will also - but that includes the pg_toast...)


as root:
(necessary?)
(does order matter?)
supervisorctl stop ttc-make-reports-main
/etc/init.d/postgresql  restart
apache-restart


as postgres:

pg_dump -t reports  -c -s > /tmp/d.sql
psql
\i /tmp/d.sql;


as root: 

supervisorctl start ttc-make-reports-main



Hung on drop index first time, before restarting things.
