Drag the 'Starting point' and 'Destination' markers 
to wherever you want - but both markers must be on the same route.

Data (i.e. traffic and 
animated vehicles) can be shown for only one route at a time.

time' for you to get from the starting point to the destination is shown 
farther down on the map page.
