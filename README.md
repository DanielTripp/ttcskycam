This is the source code behind the website (http://ttcskycam.ca/).  It's goal is to give an up-to-the-minute visual representation of public transit conditions in Toronto.  

It it based on [NextBus](http://www.nextbus.com/) data.

It is probably difficult, and not very useful, for someone to download this code and run it on their own.  I am hosting this code publicly mostly because I didn't see any reason not to.
